# breakReminder

A simple and effective reminder tool built with Python that prompts users to take breaks at regular intervals. When it's time for a break, `breakReminder` displays a full-screen window and, optionally, plays a reminder sound.

### Usage
- **In Windows**, just download the `.zip` file, extract it, and run `.exe` file.
- **In any other environment where Python is installed**, run the script from your terminal `python break_reminder.py` (Requires Python 3.6 or later and Pygame).
  
You can modify the `config.json` file to customize the interval between reminders, the music file path, and toggle music playback on or off. If you place the mp3 file next to the script or executable, all you need to do is enter the name of the music file (including the `.mp3` extension) in the musicPath parameter of the config file.
