# breakReminder

A simple and effective reminder tool built with Python that prompts users to take breaks at regular intervals. When it's time for a break, `breakReminder` displays a full-screen window and, optionally, plays a reminder sound.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- Pygame for playing music
- Tkinter for the GUI (should be included with Python)

### Usage
- For window, just download the `.zip` file, extract it, and run `.exe` file.
- For any environment that has python installed, run the script from your terminal:
```sh
python break_reminder.py
```
- (optional) Place a music file named `music.mp3` in the same directory as the script or executable file if you want music to play during your reminders.

**The `.exe` file is created using PyInstaller and has been tested on Windows 10 and 11, you can run it without needing to install Python or any dependencies.**
