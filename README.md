# breakReminder

A simple and effective reminder tool built with Python that prompts users to take breaks at regular intervals. When it's time for a break, `breakReminder` displays a full-screen window and, optionally, plays a reminder sound.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- Pygame for playing music
- Tkinter for the GUI (should be included with Python)
- (optional) Place a music file named music.mp3 in the same directory as the script if you want music to play during your reminders.

### Usage
Run the script from your terminal or command prompt:
```sh
python break_reminder.py
```
**The .exe file is created using PyInstaller and has been tested on Windows 11, you can run it without needing to install Python or any dependencies.**
