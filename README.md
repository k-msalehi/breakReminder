# breakReminder

A simple and effective reminder tool built with Python that prompts users to take breaks at regular intervals. When it's time for a break, `breakReminder` displays a full-screen window and, optionally, plays a reminder sound.

### Usage
- Run the script from your terminal `python break_reminder.py` (Requires Python 3.6 or later and Pygame).
  
You can modify the `config.json` file to customize the interval between reminders.
